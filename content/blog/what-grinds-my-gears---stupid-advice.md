I'm a fan of Family Guy. So I've decided to do something super unoriginal... _You know what really grinds my gears_? In these articles, I'll focus on something that just drives me crazy. 

So, with that said...

You know what really grinds my gears? Every time I look at a blog or watch a video dedicated to providing fashion advice to bigger guys, there's almost always a comment that sounds something like this: 

"Change your diet and go to the gym more. When you're in better shape, the clothes will fit and you'll look for fashionable"

 or

"Go to the gym and work on building size and strength with (insert body part here), having  muscular (body part) will help distract from your size and your clothes will look better."

Look... I get it. These folks seem to think that the best way to be fashionable is to have a 34 waist or have the silhouette of Dwayne Johnson. It's what we've been conditioned to think. A quick look at Esquire or GQ and that's all you see.

What really bugs me about it, is that this advice is that it's given by people who don't know what it's like to actually struggle with their weight. Sure, some of these guys, spends hours at a gym but that just reinforces their beliefs. They come with a perspective of "I'm not fat... because I put in the work. That's what these guys need to learn to do."

 

I know this is the attitude because I've been on the recieving end of it. Once, during an employee review, one of my guys tried to crack a joke. I asked the question "If you were me, what would you do differently?" The intention was to get an assessment of how I could improve my management skills but instead I got a grin followed by "I'd actually go to the gym". 

It was harsh. I was hurt and disappointed. I thought he respected me but in that moment I realized he saw of me as some fat piece of shit who just needed to work out. I kept my cool, made a couple of jokes and continued the review but all I wanted to do was tell him to go fuck himself.

That's the thing that most fashion bloggers don't realize... For a lot of Brawn guys, we are making the effort. We go to the gym and we're trying new diets all the time. I've had conversations with friends about Jenny Craig and Harvey Brooker. We've talked about fitness plans, personal trainers and trendy workouts. It's not like we spent 16 hours a day, parked on the couch eating pop tarts and playing video games. 

Me? I love Crossfit. I have a pretty busy schedule so things don't always work out as planned, but I'm usually training at least twice a week. I have tried multiple diets from paleo to intermittent fasting to nutritionist meal plans. All have been met with limited success.

So I'm tired of being told that the best way to look fashionable is to be thin. I know I'm fat, I've come to accept it but that doesn't mean I want to dress like a slob. So instead of assuming that the idea of losing weight hadn't crossed my mind just stick with what you know best... Fashion.

 

... and that's what really grinds my gears.
